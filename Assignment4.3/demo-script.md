# Live Demo Script - Conference Room Booking System

## Demo Goal
Demonstrate a complete developer workflow in under 3 minutes, showing:
1. How easy it is to get started
2. The power of our API documentation
3. The full cycle from code to running system

## Pre-Demo Setup (Before Presentation)
1. Have terminal open with repository cloned
2. Have browser open to localhost:5000/api-docs (not loaded yet)
3. Have database viewer ready (optional)
4. Close all unnecessary applications

## Demo Script (Timed: 3 minutes total)

### Segment 1: Repository Overview (30 seconds)
**What I show:** Terminal with `ls -la` of repository
**What I say:** "Here's our codebase. Notice the clean structure: `/api` for backend, `/client` for frontend, `docker-compose.yml` at root for one-command startup."
**Commands:**
```bash
ls -la
echo "Clean, predictable structure"
