When I first created the README for the Conference Room Booking System, I assumed that the audience was already familiar with Git, GitHub, and Agile practices. I also assumed they would understand the context of user stories, sprints, and Scrum artefacts without explicit guidance. This limited the clarity for new contributors or reviewers who might be unfamiliar with the project’s workflow or structure.

The updated README improves onboarding by explicitly outlining the repository structure, sprint artefacts, contribution workflow, and where to find key documentation. It introduces clear instructions for cloning the repository, reviewing artefacts, and following the Pull Request process. Additionally, placeholders for future technical sections, such as APIs and developer setup, provide a roadmap for contributors as the project evolves. This makes it easier for new team members to understand both the purpose and current state of the system within minutes.

Through working with Pull Requests and GitHub issues, I learned the importance of clear, structured communication. Constructive PR reviews and well-defined issue templates reduce ambiguity, improve traceability, and maintain a professional workflow. I also realized that providing context, steps to reproduce, and expected outcomes ensures that team members can quickly understand problems and collaborate effectively, even asynchronously.
